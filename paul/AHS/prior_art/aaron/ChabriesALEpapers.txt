abstract = {A two microphone adaptive digital noise cancellation technique was 
used to improve word-recognition ability of normally hearing and 
hearing-impaired subjects in the presence of varying amounts of 
multitalker speech babble noise and speech spectrum noise. 
Signal-to-noise ratios varied from -8 dB to +12 dB in 4 dB 
increments. The adaptive noise cancellation technique resulted in 
reducing both the speech babble and speech spectrum noises 18 to 22 
dB. This reduction in noise resulted in average improvements in word 
recognition, at the poorest signal-to-noise ratios, ranging from 37% 
to 50% for the normally hearing subjects and 27% to 40% for the 
hearing-impaired subjects. Improvements in word recognition in the 
presence of speech babble noise as a result of adaptive filtering 
were just as large or larger than improvements found in the presence 
of speech spectrum noise. The amount of improvement of 
word-recognition scores was most pronounced at the least favorable 
signal-to-noise ratios. (24 refs.)},

abstract = {Two-microphone noise cancelling using an LMS (least mean square) 
adaptive filter in real time was used to process speech recorded in 
the presence of speech-spectrum noise at six different 
signal-to-noise ratios, minus 8, minus 4, 0, 4, 8, and 12 db. Twelve 
normal-hearing and 11 sensorineural hearing-impaired subjects were 
tested. Results indicated mean improvement of 37. 34 percent for the 
12 normal-hearing subjects and 38. 3 percent for 5 of the 
sensorineural hearing-impaired subjects. Individual data for the 5 
remaining hearing-impaired subjects revealed severe speech 
intelligibility deficits when noise and reverberation contaminated 
the speech signal. It is proposed that rehabilitative audiological 
assessments include evaluation of an individual's ability to cope 
with reverberation and noise. (24 Refs.)},

removing noise from corrupted speech signals. The Widrow-Hoff LMS 
(least mean square) algorithm developed in 1959 forms the 
introduction to modern adaptive signal processing. By subtracting the 
adaptively filtered estimate of the noise, the desired speech signal 
is obtained. Recent developments in the field as they relate to noise 
cancellation are described. A second method for removing noise from 
speech, for use when no independent reference for the noise exists, 
is referred to as single channel noise suppression. Current 
techniques applied to this problem are described, including signal 
processing techniques that offer promise in the noise suppression 
application. (33 Refs.)},
